# DassDirectTagCreator
TIA Portal add-in for creating tags for Intouch DASSDirect 


Steps that are repeated in TIA Portal projects can be automated via the TIA Portal
Openness API, which saves a lot of time. TIA Portal Openness allows functions to
be selected for defined tasks in the TIA Portal, e.g. opening projects, adapting PLC
data and changing drive parameters. This means that TIA Portal Openness allows
external applications to access the TIA Portal and its various functions.


With this add-in for TIA Portal i can generate a taglist in csv format for use in Wonderware intouch Dassdirect S7 driver.
Saves me a lot of time doing it manually tag by tag.


Let me know if in doubt. will try to help.
